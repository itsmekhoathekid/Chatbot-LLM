It\u2019s relaxed, friendly, and conveys that you\u2019re leaving on a positive note. Just keep in mind:\n\n- **Tone:** It works best when the overall conversation has been informal. In a formal or professional context (e.g., a business email or a meeting with senior leadership), you\u2019d want something more polished (\u201cThank you, goodbye,\u201d or \u201cTalk soon\u201d).  \n- **Audience:** If the person you\u2019re speaking to is comfortable with slang, they\u2019ll likely appreciate the laid\u2011back vibe. If they\u2019re more formal or you\u2019re unsure, a neutral \u201csee you later\u201d is safer.  \n- **Cultural differences:** In some cultures or workplaces, even mild slang can be seen as too casual, so adjust accordingly.\n\nSo, for everyday chats with peers, \u201ccool, see ya\u201d is just fine.
